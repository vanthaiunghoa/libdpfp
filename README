libdpfp
http://dpfp.berlios.de

Currently in early development, API is unstable, library may be unreliable.

This library uses libusb to control the hardware with no dependence on any
specific kernel driver.

libdpfp is only a prototype while we learn more about this hardware and find
reliable ways of comparing fingerprints. Once this library becomes semi-useful,
it will be abandoned in favour of development of a more generic library with
the aim of supporting many different fingerprint readers in one API.
